  Introducing the exploratory variant of the OPES method, [OPES_METAD_EXPLORE](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_o_p_e_s__m_e_t_a_d__e_x_p_l_o_r_e.html). It is tested on model systems and compared with standard OPES and metadynamics. The preprint of the paper is available at [arXiv:2201.09950](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09950).
