 Run using PLUMED driver. plumed driver --mf_xtc ${sys}.xtc --plumed ${sys}_plumed.dat, where ${sys} is one of urea or glycine and ${sys}.xtc is the XTC file generated from a GROMACS trajectory. Of course, any other PLUMED driver supported trajectories should work, and the flag changed appropriately.
