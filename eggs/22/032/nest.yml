 To run this simulation you need OpenMM 7.6 or newer and the OpenMM-PLUMED plugin installed. To start the job run the following command line `python run_path-meta-eabf.py n_steps do_relax do_plumed`. For example, `python run_path-meta-eabf.py 50000 1 0` will minimize the system and run 50,000 steps of MD relaxation while `python run_path-meta-eabf.py 5000000 0 1` will read the checkpoint file and continue 5 million steps of meta-eABF simulation using the path colvar representing the opening and closing of the full CRL-VHL-degrader-SMARCA2 ring complex. NOTE. The current implementation of the PATHMSD action has a flaw that results in numerical instability due to computing `exp(-lambda*(it.distance))` with very large lambda values, without scaling. I highly recommend to make the following simple edit to `PathMSDBase.cpp` to introduce proper scaling.
