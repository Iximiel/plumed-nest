 Introducing the OPES Flooding method for calculating kinetics of rare event processes. It is tested on model systems and folding/unfolding of chignolin. The MD engine used is GROMACS 2021. The Deep-LDA and Deep-TICA CV were trained using Pytorch 1.8.2 and mlcvs package. Note. The OPES flooding method is available from PLUMED version 2.8. But the Deep-LDA and Deep-TICA CV we used in this work are implemented in PLUMED 2.9.
