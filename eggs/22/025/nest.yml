  LAMMPS and PLUMED input files for calculation of bubble nucleation rates in Lennard-Jones fluids. Combines the reweighted Jarzynski sampling recipe with recrossing-corrected TST for rate calculation. Python with scikit-learn is also needed for intermediate processing. See README for more details.
