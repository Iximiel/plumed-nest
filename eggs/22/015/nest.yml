  Input files for PLUMED 2.8 to run variationally enhanced sampling on bacteriophytochrome-biliverdin complexes in the red and far-red photoactive states. Simulations use the VES module. VES needs to be enabled when configuring the compilation of PLUMED by using the "--enable-modules=ves" flag. PDB ID [red](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4O0P); PDB ID [far-red](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4O01); [AMBER03 FF](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b01117).
