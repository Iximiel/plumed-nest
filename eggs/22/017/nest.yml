  This egg contains the input files for replicating Trypsin-Benzamidine ligand binding simulations with Deep-LDA and Deep-TICA CVs. These CVs accelerate water throughout the binding/unbinding events. For more information about Deep-LDA, we refer to [plumID:20.004](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/22/004/) and about Deep-TICA to [plumID:21.039](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/21/039/). The CVs were trained with Pytorch version 1.4 and the simulations were run with Gromacs 2020.4.
