 Detailed instruction under README.dat file. The topology and coordinate files were prepared in AMBER18, proceeded by ParmED. Then, they were converted to GROMACS format by ParmED. GROMACS-v2018 and PLUMED-v2.5.6 were used for the WT-MetaD-HREX simulations, and the latter was also used for data processing.
