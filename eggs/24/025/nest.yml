 This egg contains the input files for replicating the unbiased classical MD simulations and enhanced sampling OPES simulations using Deep TDA CVs, and path CV for alpha-amylase enzyme with four different sugar substrates. The path CV used in OPES simulations enhances the sampling (in the Deep TDA CVs’ space) of different substrate-binding modes within the enzyme’s active site. For more information about Deep TDA, we refer to plumID:21.028. The CVs were trained with Pytorch version 1.8 and the simulations were run with GROMACS 2021.5, and PLUMED 2.9.
