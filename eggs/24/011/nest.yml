 The Müller-Brown potential’s simulations have been performed using the MD engine in the ves_md_linearexpansion module of PLUMED. The vacuum alanine dipeptide simulations have been carried out using the GROMACS v2021.5 MD engine and the Amber99-SB force field. The DASA reaction simulations have been carried out using the CP2K-8.1 software package at PM6 semi-empirical level. For the study of folding and unfolding of chignolin in explicit solvent, we performed our simulations using GROMACS v2021.5 the CHARMM22∗ force field and TIP3P water force field.
