 We did OneOPES calculations on multiple protein-ligand systems, for each system there are 8 replicas, for each replica there is a plumed.dat file. The SBATCH scripts we used to run the calculations are on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11126468). Calculations were run with GROMACS 2022 patched with Plumed-2.9.
