 Simulations have been performed with GROMACS 2018.3 and PLUMED 2.4.3. The input files for HREX simulations of several ligand-protein complexes are provided, along with PLUMED input files for the analysis of free-in-solution and target-bound conformational heterogeneity of ligands (aka the cryptic ligand envelope).
