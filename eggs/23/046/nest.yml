instructions:
 These are AMBER and PLUMED files to run Well-Tempered Metadynamics for each lasso peptide (MccJ25, ulleungdin and sungsanpin) with two CVs. One of the CVs biases the isopeptide bond between residues 1 and 8 and the second is defined by HLDA as a combination of weighted distances from the ring 1-8 to the piercing residue.
