 PLUMED input files to perform Shadow Mixed-Solvent MetaDynamics simulations. Simulations have been performed with the master branch of PLUMED available [here](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2) and GROMACS 2021.5. All the GROMACS topology files are available [here](https://github.com/COSBlab/SHAMAN-benchmark).
