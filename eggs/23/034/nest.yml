instructions:
 The three folders contain the input files for the simulations with the full model, the Gaussian-truncated model, and the short solvent model, respectively. The .intl file is the initial configuration for the urea-water system. The GT_potential.table contains tabulated Gaussian-truncated electrostatic potentials. The urea_lmf.table contains tabulated renormalized long-range electrostatic potentials in the short solvent model. The ${sys}1.in file is the input script for LAMMPS-29Sep2021, where ${sys} stands for the corresponding model, and ${sys}2.in is the input script if one needs to restart the simulation continued from ${sys}1.in.
