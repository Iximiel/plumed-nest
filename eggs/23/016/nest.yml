 Multiple-walkers Metadynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS 2019.4 with the PLUMED 2.5.3 plug-in. Topologies for the receptors were generated using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field. Ligands were parameterized using the generalized AMBER force field (GAFF) together with AM1-BCC partial charges.
