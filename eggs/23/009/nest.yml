 Introducing the Transition Path Informed Deep Targeted Discriminant Analysis (TPI-Deep-TDA) method for improving deep neural network-based collective variables by utilizing information about the transition pathways. It is tested on Muller potential, folding/unfolding of chignolin, and ligand binding in the OAMe-G2 complex studied in SAMPL5 challenge. The MD engine used is GROMACS 2021. The Deep-TDA and TPI-Deep-TDA CV were trained using Pytorch 1.8.2 and mlcvs package.
