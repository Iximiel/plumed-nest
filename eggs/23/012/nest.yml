instructions:
 To run this calculation you need OpenMM 7.6 or later. 'python run-2D-meta-eABF-path-CV.py' will start the job. Directories run0-run9 contain data to demonstrate how to compute rigorous statistical error estimate for the PMF using boot strapping. The README file contains the instructions.
