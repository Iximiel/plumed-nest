 This egg contains the input files for replicating the reaction discovery and enhanced sampling OPES simulations for alpha-amylase enzyme with a sugar substrate using graph CV, Deep TDA CVs, and path CV. The graph CVs accelerate the exploration of the enzymatic reaction space in QM/MM discovery MD simulations with the explore version of OPES. The path CV used in OPES simulations enhances the sampling (in the Deep TDA CVs' space) of different substrate-binding modes within the enzyme's active site. For more information about Deep TDA, we refer to [plumID:21.028](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/21/028/) and graph-CV to [plumID:22.004](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/22/004/). The CVs were trained with Pytorch version 1.8 and the simulations were run with GROMACS 2021.5, CP2K 9.1, and PLUMED 2.9.
