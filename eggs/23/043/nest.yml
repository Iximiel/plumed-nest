 This project is associated with the recent preprint "Modeling the ferroelectric phase transition in barium titanate with DFT accuracy and converged sampling" by L. Gigli et al. and available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12579). In this work, we study the effect of system size in the thermodynamics of barium titanate, by performing metadynamics simulations with PLUMED, LAMMPS, i-Pi and librascal. Modifications to the PLUMED source code (forked from the hack-the-tree branch) were required for the construction of a custom collective variable that mimicks the polarization of the system. The github repository [here](https://github.com/lgigli/BTO-paper) provides links to the up-to-date versions of the codes used, instructions on how to install the software stack and an example of a metadynamics run.
