instructions: > Included are the input files to perform a metainference calculation using SAXS data as restraints and our latest hybrid SAXS forward model. 
This model allows for the inclusion of a solvent layer correction term. The simulations are meant to be performed using GROMACS and multiple replicas in the case of GELSOLIN, while using a single replica in the case of UP1.
