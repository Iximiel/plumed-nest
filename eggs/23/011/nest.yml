 This egg contains the input files for replicating the results contained in the OneOPES paper. OneOPES is a method that combines the power of CV-based enhanced sampling and replica exchange by combining different version of OPES, namely OPES, OPES Explore and OPES Multithermal. We applied OneOPES to Alanine Dipeptide, Trypsin-Benzamidine and Chignolin. The simulations were run in combination with Gromacs 2022.5.
