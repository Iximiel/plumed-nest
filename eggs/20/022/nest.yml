  Perform replica-exchange-like sampling using a bias-potential method based on collective variables. Using OPES allows for fast convergence and requires extremely few external parameters. Only post-processing required is a simple umbrella-sampling reweighting.  The provided code is fully functional, but a more general implementation will be available as a separate PLUMED module, using a slightly different input syntax. More information on the method can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03055).
