  Perform replica-exchange-like sampling using a bias-potential method based on collective variables. Using OPES allows for fast convergence and requires extremely few external parameters. Only post-processing required is a simple umbrella-sampling reweighting.  More information on the method can be found here [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_o_p_e_s.html).
