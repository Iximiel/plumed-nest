 These are the input files used to fully converge the free energy landscapes of the human soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, PDB code 5AKK) using different methodologies, Funnel-shaped restraint metadynamics (fun-metaD), funnel-shaped restraint with SWISH (fun-SWISH) and COMetPath. The input files were used with GROMACS 2018.3 and PLUMED 2.4.2 using the AMBER99SB-disp force field. They include a novel COLVAR(ProjectionOnAxis.cpp) which is included in all directories.
