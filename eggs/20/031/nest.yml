  Open data of the enhanced sampling simulations of fluorescent soft nanoshuttles binding folate receptor alpha, varying the length of ethylene glycol repeating units (4, 8 or 16) as m04, m08 and m16 in this repository. PLUMED package (v. 2.7.0) was used within GROMACS v.2020.2.  The data include the coordinates belonging to the free-energy minimum of the complex, the topologies, the force field parameters and PLUMED files.
