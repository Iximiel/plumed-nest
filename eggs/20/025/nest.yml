 This egg contains the input files for replicating ligand binding simulations from the SAMPL5 challenge with a Deep-LDA CV. The CV focuses on accelerating the water throughout the binding/unbinding events. For more information about Deep-LDA, we refer to [plumID:20.004](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/20/004/). The CVs were trained with Pytorch version 1.4 and the simulations were run with Gromacs 2019.4.
