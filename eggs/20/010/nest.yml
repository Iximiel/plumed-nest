  The simulations were performed with LAMMPS and the master branch of PLUMED. The crystallization and ves modules of PLUMED have to be enabled. The light branch of the GitHub repository does not contain outputs. You can find output files for the simulations in the master branch [here](https://github.com/PabloPiaggi/Crystallization-of-IceIh).
