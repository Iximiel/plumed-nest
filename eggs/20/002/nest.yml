 The following plumed.dat script allows users to perform a Well-Tempered Metadynamics on Venus fly-trap GABAB receptor, in order to simulate conformational changes (open-to-closed), along the pathMSD CV previously parametrized from multiple classical MDs trajecories. All simulations were performed using GROMACS2016 and PLUMED 2.4
