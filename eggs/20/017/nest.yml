 This file contains three examples. 1) An analytical 'v-shaped' potential, which is run with FISST using the PLUMED driver. It also contains a python script to analyze the results. 2) A toy helix model to run in LAMMPS (any version with PLUMED). This has an example of FISST and pulling with a single applied force on the ends. 3) FISST applied to ends of Alanine-10, to run in GROMACS (tested in 2018.6)  Each has a run_example.sh script that shows how to perform one representative simulation from the paper. More info [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14064).
