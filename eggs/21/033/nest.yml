 This allows to run multiple-path-metadynamics on the Watson-Crick-Franklin to Hoogsteen base-pairing transition of an A-T pair in DNA. It requires PLUMED compiled with MPI and with the Path-CV code provided within. It also requires an MD engine that can run parallel replicas. We use GROMACS 2018.8 compiled with MPI.
