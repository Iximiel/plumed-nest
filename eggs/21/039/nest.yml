 Improve biased simulations by extracting slow modes that hinder convergence and accelerating them. This egg contains input files and data necessary to perform the exploratory simulations, train the neural network CVs and enhance their sampling. Note that some of the builds fail because PLUMED needs to be manually compiled against LibTorch. Code to train the Deep-TICA CVs and instructions for configuring PLUMED can be found on [Github](https://github.com/luigibonati/deep-learning-slow-modes). More info about the method can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03943).
