 These files make it possible to rerun all simulations. The directory METAD contains input files for metadynamics (no folding events observed). The directory PT-METAD contains input files for parallel tempering metadynamics. All simulations were done using Gromacs 2016.4, Anncolvar 0.8, Plumed 2.4 and OpenMPI 4.0.0.
