 These are the input files used to converge the puckering free energy landscapes of the acceptor uronic acid of the chicken 2-o-sulfotransferase (PDB code 4NDZ) and the water coordination around the catalytic histidine of the zebrafish 6-o-sulfotransferase. The input files were used with amber16 and PLUMED 2.3.8 for calculating the puckering metadynamics and GROMACS 2018.3 and PLUMED 2.4.2.
