 Included are the PLUMED input files to run Metadynamics Hamiltonian Replica Exchange between ground and first two excited states of a 5-mer of poly(9,9-dioctylfluoren-2,7-diyl), as well as GROMACS topology and mdp files. Simulations have been run with GROMACS version 2020.2 equipped with PLUMED 2.7.
