 This egg contains the input files to reproduce the simulations with Deep-TDA CV of alanine folding, a calyxarene host-guest system in explicit solvent, the multi-state hydrobromination of propene and a step-wise intramolecular double proton transfer reaction. The Deep-TDA CV is expressed as the output of a feed-forward neural network trained imposing that the configurations in the different minima are distributed in the projected CV space according to a preassigned target distribution. Note that the build fails because PLUMED needs to be manually compiled with Libtorch to import the trained model from Pytorch with the interface from [Bonati et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2020, 11, 2998â€“3004](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c00535). We have made available a Google Colab Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TO7bAkmIznsdfea2i5NXfNtytJrnkkIt?usp=sharing) with a tutorial for the training of the Deep-TDA CV and indications on the PLUMED configuration required. The input files for the training are also included in this egg.
