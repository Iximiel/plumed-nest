 For all systems, gro and top are provided. In the folders HST-GST/CB8-G6 and GSK/3, the plumed_path.dat files are provided in order to run Well-Tempered MetaD with PCVs along the dissociation paths that have been optimized in terms of spacing between consecutive frames. The input files were used with GROMACS 2016.5 and PLUMED 2.5.
