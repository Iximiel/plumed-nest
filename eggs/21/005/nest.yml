 This entry includes all input files required to run OPES simulations with the Structure Factor Deep-LDA collective variable. The simulations were carried out in GROMACS-2019.4 patched with PLUMED-2.7-dev code. Additionally, it requires a PyTorch interface which is discussed [here](https://www.plumed-nest.org/eggs/20/004/).
