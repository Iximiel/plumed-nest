The plumed.dat and input files can be used to run Metadynamics calculations of a Langevin particle in 2, 3 and 6 dimensions. This is achieved by moving 2 or 3 atoms in a potential identified by the components of their distances. The plumed_reweight.dat files are used to create the weights for the Metadynamics calculation, and reweight the biased trajectory to obtain the unbiased probability distribution. For the LJ-38 examples, the .zip file contains also the input data and input script for LAMMPS, as well as the plumed.dat for the Metadynamics and plumed_reweight.dat for the reweighting.
