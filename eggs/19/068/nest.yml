instructions: >
 On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) is a new method that, building on the long experience with metadynamics, aims at making enhanced sampling more efficient and easier to use. All the input files of the simulations in the paper are provided, together with the results and post-processing python scripts. From v2.7 OPES is included in PLUMED as a contributed module, see [here](https://www.plumed.org/doc-master/user-doc/html/_o_p_e_s.html).
