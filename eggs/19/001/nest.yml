  The zip file contains GROMACS topologies and input files together with
  a plumed example file. Notice that the simulations in the paper were performed
  using bias exchange metadynamics, and the example input correspond to a single
  replica (the one where ligand binding to residue 3 was enhanced). Input files
  for all replicas should be similarly created in order to run a real simulation.
