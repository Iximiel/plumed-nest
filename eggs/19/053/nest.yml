  The input file here can be used to calculate the Fourier transform of the position of the interface between the solid and liquid phases of the material. 
  As discussed in the paper the ensemble average of this Fourier transform is related to the surface stiffness.   In the paper, calculations were performed 
  with LAMMPS and analyzed with PLUMED.
