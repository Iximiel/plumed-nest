 Input files for the simulation of the Ntail IDP using the PTMetaD-WTE scheme. The zip comprises two directories: step-1 and step-2. The former contains the equilibrated *.gro files at each of the 8 temperatures considered, plus the plumed.*.dat necessary to enlarge the fluctuations of the potential energy by sampling the well-tempered ensemble (WTE) along with the GROMACS (version 4.6.7) *.mdp files needed to launch the simulation. The second directory includes the plumed.*.dat files to subsequently combine this PT-WTE scheme with a metadynamics simulation using the radius of gyration and the alpha helical content as CVs, resulting in the PTMetaD-WTE framework.
