 This repository has the necessary code to run annealing and umbrella simulations of collagen-mimetic peptoids. Files are organized as follows. The `Annealing` Folder contains initial structure (npt.gro) and topology files (topol.top); Code generating PLUMED files to track CVs (gen_plumed.py); molecular dynamics parameters for annealing (npt_run.mdp); Example PLUMED file (plumed0.dat); code to run the MD (anneal.sbatch and run_sim.py). The `Umbrella` Folder contains initial structure (npt.gro) and topology files (topol.top); Code generating TICA object and PLUMED files to bias CVs (make_tica_plumed.py); molecular dynamics parameters for equilibration and umbrella runs (umbrella_equil.mdp and umbrella_run.mdp, respectively); Example PLUMED file (plumed.dat); code to run the MD (run_umbrella.sbatch).
