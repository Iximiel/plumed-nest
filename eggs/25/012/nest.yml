 This egg contains the input files for replicating committor training and enhanced sampling OPES simulations with a smoother version of the committor as a CV for calculating FES, reaction mechanisms and TS ensembles for alpha-amylase enzyme catalyzing a sugar substrate. The CV was trained with Pytorch version 1.8 and the simulations were run with GROMACS 2021.5, CP2K 9.1, and PLUMED 2.9.
